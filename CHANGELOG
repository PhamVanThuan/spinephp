Spine PHP Change Log (http://www.spinephp.org/)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THERE IS NO OFFICIAL/STABLE RELEASE OF SPINE

(3rd August 2010)
-----------------------------------------------
[changed]: Folder structure has been updated to allow better understanding of where
things should belong.
[changed]: A template parser is no longer supported, however support for Smarty will
be added.
[new]: Libraries can be autoloaded by a controller via the $libs property.
[new]: Basic Smarty implementation. Smarty cannot use Helpers, both in views and in 
templates. Smarty can be unhooked, which stops the hook and calls the unhook param.

-----------------------------------------------
[changed]: The entire system has been re-done as a static system to allow easier
access to the different libraries.
[changed]: File names no longer have .view, .model, .section and .controller
file extensions, it's just .php.
[new]: install.php checks environment for correct configuration.
